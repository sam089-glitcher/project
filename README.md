## Simple Calculator
Description: The Simple Calculator application is a basic calculator that can perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This application helps users practice working with user input, functions, and conditional statements.

Usage: Run the calculator.py file to launch the Simple Calculator. Follow the prompts to perform calculations and obtain results.

## Password Generator
Description: The Password Generator is a utility that generates strong, random passwords. Users can specify the length of the passwords they need. This project provides hands-on experience with random number generation and string manipulation.

Usage: Execute the password_generator.py script to run the Password Generator. You will be prompted to enter the desired password length, and the tool will generate a password accordingly.

## Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
Description: The Rock, Paper, Scissors Game is a fun and interactive text-based game. Players can compete against the computer in the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. This project demonstrates basic game logic and conditional statements.

Usage: Start the game by running the rock_paper_scissors.py file. Follow the on-screen instructions to play against the computer and see if you can win!

## Quiz Game
Description: The Quiz Game is a quiz application that allows users to answer a series of multiple-choice questions. It provides a sample set of questions and answers for learning and practicing quiz-style applications. The project emphasizes file input/output and user interaction.

Usage: Launch the Quiz Game by running the quiz_game.py script. You will be presented with questions and options to select the correct answer. Test your knowledge and have fun!
